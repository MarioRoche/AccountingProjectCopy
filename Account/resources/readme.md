We have an accounting system, in which there are
1. Users, who are identified by email and/or phone number
2. Account, which hold funds. A user can  have multiple accounts.
3. Postings, which are the debit/credit transactions posted on an account.

The schema for these are defined in db.sql file.

You also given and class MysqlHelper.java, which returns you a mysql connection.
You need to implement the Accounting interface, defined in Accounting.java



What you need to do.
- There are 4 methods to be implemented in Accounting interface. You need to implement at least 2 to reach next round.
- Implementing all 4 methods and writing tests for them is desired.
- While doing all this make sure you write good quality code.
- Once you are done with this problem and time remaining, we have a bonus problem as well.

What you will be evaluated on:
1. Code completeness and correctness
2. Code cleanliness
    - Readbility
    - Reusability
    - Modularity
    - Testability
4. Tests
